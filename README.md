## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea
Railway stations are complex environments with multiple facilities like ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, and waiting areas. Passengers, especially first-time visitors or those with disabilities, face difficulties navigating these spaces efficiently. This project aims to develop a multi-platform navigation system that offers real-time, accessible, and user-friendly guidance using interactive maps, voice assistance, and digital kiosks.
Improve passenger experience by reducing navigation difficulties.

Provide real-time updates on station layout changes.

Ensure accessibility features for differently-abled individuals.

Integrate with railway services for seamless travel assistance.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
Solution Overview:
The proposed system consists of:

A mobile application with 3D interactive maps for real-time navigation.

Digital kiosks with touch-screen interfaces for offline navigation.

Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers.

AI-powered congestion detection to suggest less crowded routes.

Integration with railway APIs to sync real-time train schedules.

## Use Cases
1. Passenger Navigation
Actors: Passenger, Navigation System

Description: Users can enter their destination within the station (e.g., platform, ticket counter) and receive step-by-step navigation assistance.

2. Accessibility Support
Actors: Visually Impaired Passenger, Voice Assistant

Description: The system provides voice instructions and haptic feedback to help visually impaired users reach their destinations.

3. Real-time Congestion Monitoring
Actors: Station Navigation System, IoT Sensors

Description: The system monitors crowd density in different station areas and suggests alternative routes to avoid congestion.

4. Emergency Navigation
Actors: Passengers, Station Authorities

Description: In case of emergencies, the system directs passengers to the nearest exits or safe zones.

(You can also add Use Case Diagrams to visually represent these scenarios.)
